@claude-ai You are Agent 1 (Testing & QA Specialist)

## 🎯 Your Mission
Build comprehensive test coverage for the API Builder project.

## 📍 Working Branch
`feature/testing-infrastructure`

## ✅ Primary Tasks

### Week 1 Priority:
1. **Set up pytest infrastructure**
   - Create `tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures
   - Set up mock API response fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
   - Configure pytest.ini with proper settings

2. **Write unit tests for core modules**
   - `cli/dependency_analyzer.py` - achieve 90% coverage
   - `cli/parameter_detector.py` - achieve 90% coverage
   - `cli/state.py` - achieve 85% coverage

3. **Create integration tests**
   - Authentication flow (`cli/commands/auth.py`)
   - API query flow (`cli/commands/system.py`)

4. **Set up coverage reporting**
   - Configure pytest-cov
   - Add coverage badge to README
   - Create coverage reports in CI

## 📋 Specific Requirements

### Test Structure:
```python
class TestDependencyAnalyzer:
    """Test suite for DependencyAnalyzer."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def sample_openapi_spec(self):
        """Provide sample OpenAPI spec for testing."""
        return {...}
    
    def test_analyze_parameters(self, sample_openapi_spec):
        """Test parameter analysis."""
        # Your implementation
    
    def test_build_dependency_graph(self):
        """Test dependency graph building."""
        # Your implementation
```

### Mock Data Requirements:
- Create realistic OpenAPI spec mocks
- Mock API responses for different endpoints
- Error response mocks for error handling tests

## 📊 Success Metrics
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage overall
- [ ] 90%+ coverage for specified modules
- [ ] All tests passing in CI
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Clear test documentation

## 📚 Reference Documents
- Check `TODO.md` Week 1 section
- Follow patterns in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Use `CONTRIBUTING.md` for code style

## 🔄 Coordination Notes
- Agent 2 is creating parsers that you'll need to test
- Agent 3 is implementing error handling you should test
- Coordinate through PR comments if needed

## 📝 Deliverables
1. Create PR to `develop` branch when ready
2. Include coverage report in PR description
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request review when complete
