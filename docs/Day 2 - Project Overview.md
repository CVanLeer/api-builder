# Day 2 - Project Overview

## Authentication System Enhancement

### Summary
Enhanced the API authentication system to provide better security, automatic token refresh, and improved user experience.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Secure Token Display
- Modified `auth get-token` command to no longer display the access token
- Now shows "âœ… Access Token Updated" message instead
- Prevents accidental token exposure in terminal history

#### 2. Credential Storage with Encryption
- Added secure storage for email and password using Fernet encryption
- Credentials are stored in `.env` file with encrypted passwords
- Added `cryptography` package dependency for encryption support
- Key components:
  - `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Auto-generated key for password encryption
  - `AUTH_EMAIL`: Stored email address
  - `AUTH_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED`: Encrypted password
  - `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Bearer token for API calls

#### 3. Automatic Re-authentication
- Implemented automatic retry mechanism for 401 (Unauthorized) errors
- When an API call fails with 401:
  1. System attempts to re-authenticate using stored credentials
  2. If successful, retries the original request with new token
  3. If failed, logs error and prompts manual authentication
- Created `cli/utils/api_client.py` with `make_api_request()` wrapper function

#### 4. Enhanced Configuration Management
- Updated `cli/config.py` with new functions:
  - `encrypt_password()` / `decrypt_password()`: Handle password encryption
  - `save_credentials()`: Store email and encrypted password
  - `get_saved_credentials()`: Retrieve and decrypt stored credentials
  - `auto_authenticate()`: Perform automatic authentication
  - `update_env_file()`: Safely update .env file entries

#### 5. Improved Error Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout authentication flow
- Error messages include:
  - Failed decryption attempts
  - Missing credentials
  - Authentication failures with status codes
  - Clear instructions when manual intervention needed

### File Changes

1. **cli/commands/auth.py**
   - Updated to save credentials on successful authentication
   - Modified token display behavior

2. **cli/config.py**
   - Added encryption/decryption functionality
   - Migrated from JSON to .env file storage
   - Added automatic authentication support

3. **cli/utils/api_client.py** (New)
   - Created API request wrapper with auto-retry logic
   - Handles 401 errors gracefully

4. **cli/endpoints/gettattle/locations.py**
   - Updated to use new `make_api_request()` function
   - Simplified code and added auto-retry capability

5. **pyproject.toml**
   - Added `cryptography` dependency

### Usage

1. Initial authentication:
   ```bash
   poetry run python cli/main.py auth get-token
   ```

2. Making API calls:
   ```bash
   poetry run python cli/main.py system query-api /locations
   ```

3. The system will automatically:
   - Use stored access token
   - Re-authenticate if token expires
   - Log any authentication failures

### Security Considerations
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Encryption key is generated per installation
- All sensitive data stored in `.env` (should be in .gitignore)
- Token refresh happens transparently to the user

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing token expiration tracking
- Add command to clear stored credentials
- Extend auto-retry logic to all API endpoints
- Add unit tests for authentication flow
